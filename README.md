[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danieleades/harbourmaster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danieleades/harbourmaster)

Harbourmaster is a library of high-level abstractions of Docker objects.

Harbourmaster is built on top of the excellent '[shiplift](https://github.com/softprops/shiplift)', but provides an object-oriented interface that
is a little easier to work with for some use cases.

Particularly useful for unit testing that involves spinning up and then removing Docker containers.
